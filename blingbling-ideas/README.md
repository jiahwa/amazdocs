## blingbling ideas

- One of the company’s sales directors, who chose between a powerpoint and a word document.

    Suddenly feel the threshold of sales is low-about equal to PPT + speak, running a drafting exchange program (selling PPT ideas) + artificial intelligence (intelligent pronunciation software) company, is it possible to replace the sales work.

- User@FallingSnow created an issue for the event-stream repository on GitHub under the title: I Don’t know what to say. , which translates roughly to “I’m speechless, too.”. Because the event-stream package suddenly has an extra dependency named flatmap-stream that is stealing the user’s digital currency. Event-stream is used by a number of popular front-end frameworks and libraries, with ten million downloads per month. This dependency is also used in the Vue-cli, the official scaffold of Vue, and as one of the most popular front-end frameworks, the impact is quite significant. React, on the other hand, escaped the impact.

    An increasing number of attackers may target these dependencies as the NPM invention, which in some ways is a failure, or the lack of a toolring makes it better, nodejs allows you to bypass the sandbox and many restrictions to operate your computer. Now we need a clean or an aimeye to scan or expose the content.

- I need a scanning pen to translate for me.

    In the optional text, there is a sun (moon, corresponding to two strong/weak light modes)45 degrees to the upper right of the pen tip. If I stop and move the pen for 1s, it shows me the perspective icon for exit, mode, and switching languages. Clicking on the icon will create a Jell o effect. When I finish the switch, click exit again, and the auto translated text will appear in the pen’s shadow.

    * Found a new one that works [The Salazar word open source project](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict). Look at Notice website:https://saladict.crimx.com/notice.html , which is relatively close to the function of the scanner.Thinking a lot later I find that in this UE on the basis of building a website of their own is also good, after what new dynamic come back to update.

    * I had an idea a long time ago, and now I’m writing it down. In English, the meaning of a conditional sentence is reversed from left to right, followed by the translation of the conditional sentence from left to right, followed by the translation of the conditional sentence. In this case, the hypothetical scanning pen is next to impossible. Now I have a new idea-scanning pen shadow tape, from the beginning of the word, until the end of a full stop, the whole sentence translation.

- The Es language features proposal process, graphically described as:

    ```
    Stage 0 is "i've got a crazy idea", 
        stage 1 is "this idea might not be stupid", 
        stage 2 is "let's use polyfills and transpilers to play with it", 
        stage 3 is "let's let browsers implement it and see how it goes", 
        stage 4 is "now it's javascript".
    ```

    It’s also useful to follow this process to see what good ideas come to fruition.

- The interview process of the company resource consumption is also very serious, if the intelligent interview system can be completed at the moment, replace or subordinate human interview, will save a lot of human costs.

    The initial idea is: 1. First, according to the big data for the interviewer rating, 2. After the interview process extract the most important information points, mapping skills, skill levels, for example: for example, only used Vue scaffolding construction project, then Vue scaffolding skill level is Level1, then if the decision is not recognized, can be initiated by the interviewer jump-level interview application, by the system to re-launch the new difficulty of the targeted skills interview. 3. The final Atlas and recording will be retained in the system together.

- Since there is a large amount of data that is repeatedly entered into the software development process, can you create a snapshot of the input, store and restore the previous data to simplify the complexity of test development.

    The initial idea is: 1. Vue-devtools, a tool like vue-devtools, can take a snapshot of the transaction data when you enable debugging. 2. Virtual dom-based mapping system to design it, so the existing system node or operation completely lossless. 3. You can add and remove, enable and stop 4 at any time. It’s easy to install, either by using the browser environment to install the browser version, or by using the operating system to install the keyboard to listen. 5. Keyboard hearing aid (is a keyboard assistant plug-in, can be used to record the keyboard input of all information and directional storage, and finally release to the specified program input and simulate the operation of the specified program)

- I ran into Hcy Sunyang() today, [an article about James’s “like” answer, I felt that the content of the words, every word, was impeccable, it was a perfect combination of knowledge and debate](https://www.zhihu.com/people/huo-chun-yang-77).

    The reason for this blog comment is that I clicked on the blog page when I was looking up the use case scenario of markRaw removing object responsiveness from Vue (so it can’t be proxied) , and then flipped through the history of the blog answers, it is interesting to see the key element of this secondary record as a source of inspiration: the possibility of solving the coding scenario on the mobile side.

    As someone on the Blogger’s blog put it: What’s handy to look at the code whenever you want to get started with the surface go? How do you check, compare, modify, and connect on a mobile device? These are a series of problems that benefit programmers, and if you can do them, you’ll be much more productive.

    The initial idea is: 
    1. Dynamic editing similar to codePen, mobile screen size, more reasonable layout, excellent UE experience.
     2. New Smart Data Protection Features, and it is easy to implement such as: Program background smart save to Local > > to the cloud, in order to prevent the device power failure, crash and so do not save or damage to the case of data loss problems. 
     3. Function segment highlighting eye protection, segment organization, Click Jump, function segment analysis capabilities. 
     4. Run analysis, a single JS function can be executed locally on the phone, and the implementation of the project, because to rely on the harsh environment, there should be no good means, if there is a cloud server can do synchronous upload.
     5. Save the kid who reads the Code on Kindle IREADER.

- Graphic website building, https://www.akveo.com/blur-admin/#/dashboard.

- There are two types of positions available at AXURE: Product Manager and interaction designer. Of course, want to do the above two positions, but also will, demand analysis mining, interaction ideas, interaction design, product management, coordination and communication.

    * The five elements mentioned in the elements of user experience are the strategic layer, the scope layer, the structure layer, the framework layer, and the presentation layer. When you can really understand these five elements, you can become a real product manager.

    * The positioning of the product experience, one person put it this way: define the product to be developed, not obsess over the details.

    * Having a deep mind is far more important than having only a pair of dexterous hands

    * What is Ui, what is Rd,

    * The requirements for interaction vary from company to company, depending on the company’s requirements for interaction. If It’s a TOC, it should be a little more demanding, because it’s better for the user to use.

    * Do not lag in the matter, grass, wood, bamboo and stone can be a sword. Since then refined, gradually in the absence of a sword to win the state of the sword!

- On-line generation of SVG verification code.

- Expensive customization of personal paper painting and calligraphy.

    A lot of times, the idea of some fleeting, some seize the precipitation down, feel the need to write down.
    
    Some thoughts on personal charm aside. Before this, just came out of the southwest gate of the community at 8 o’clock, thinking about the future possibility of the country and the individual, the blindness of the choice, and how to follow the decision of the heart will form. In the past to the subway station anti-l line in the second half of the time, not consciously think of the large new monopoly between small enterprises and the balance, the existence of weak will not necessarily be eliminated. Thinking of last night, some thoughts about the nation and the country, under the condition of the unity of the main body of the national spirit, the thought of unification is playing an important role, and people are more likely to be close to and have the long-cherished wish of national reunification, such as a certain bay and the mainland, like Austria and NZ Germany.

    If there’s a book about what’s going to happen, it’s history. If It’s a story that’s almost as true as history, and nothing really happened, one could argue that he was merely witnessing the possibility of history on the other side.

    This led me to believe, once again, that the usefulness of words can not be seen in the context of a shift in social patterns, a shift in mainstream consciousness, and that this might be a way out of the current swamp of thinking, and calmly head into the future.

    There is some speculation about the future of literature, and if the barriers to access are raised, will there be a market to pay for it. The idea came from the idea of writing a letter home to my second brother, on paper, in what was once a modest but now extravagant way.

    Think, how the unity of culture, to rely on language, to rely on language, to rely on movement, to rely on inheritance, so there is a voice, with the text, with mobilization, with history to follow. If there is a revolution, I think it all starts with listening, editing, and expressing ideas. I think it will be a long process.

- Code execution in the cloud has always been a problem, so how do you end up with this problem, a cluster of stateless single-execution statements for your code. If that were true, what would the future look like in the cloud, where computing power would be spread out over individual, centralized functions.

- One scan, or a simple interaction to retrieve text or content from an image, is currently based on OCR technology, but other implementations are unknown. There is some room for improvement, such as the principle of neural networks to improve it will be useful.

- Faststone does not have a Mac version, the best use of Windows Metrics, color pipette, screenshots tools, one of which simulate the function of practical use. And now, I use Python to achieve this idea.

- Preliminary ideas, from this document [from zero-realized and extended freely drawn sheets] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jjmkeka5vc-qt3xccankig), first based on freely drawn drawings, Draw automatic molding, combination when completing the closest goals.Second, on the basis of the drawing board, the regular document can be completed by the speed, just like the translation tool.

- Another idea about the application, such as I want to realize a blog site, then look for the ideal blog in the Internet, and then imitate the hands to implement them, and gradually add your own good idea in the future.
